# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* To reduce the time spent on manually recording and summarizing business data.
* To increase the accuracy of financial and product stock data.
* To enable the shop owner to access insights and make faster business decisions.
* To create a centralized system for managing all of the shop's data (repairs, sales, purchases, stock).

## Background Context
This project was initiated to solve the problem of a repair shop owner who manages all business data through a manual process using a notebook, which results in delays, risks of error, and a lack of a real-time business overview. This frontend application will be built to connect with the existing Strapi API, serving as a dashboard for displaying summaries and as a tool for managing all data digitally.
