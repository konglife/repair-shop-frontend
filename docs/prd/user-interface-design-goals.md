# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a user experience that is Minimalist, Efficient, and User-friendly. The user must be able to access data and manage tasks quickly without a steep learning curve.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
* Use Data Tables that support searching, sorting, and filtering.
* Use Forms and Modals/Dialogs for adding and editing data.
* The main Dashboard will be Card-based to display summaries for each section and will include Charts for key statistical data.

## Core Screens and Views
* Login Page
* Main Dashboard
* Products Management Page
* Stock Management Page
* Purchases Management Page
* Repair Jobs Management Page
* Sales Management Page

## Accessibility
* **None:** In this MVP version, we will not specifically focus on WCAG requirements but will rely on the basic accessibility standards that come with MUI.

## Branding
* Primarily use the basic, modern, and beautiful design of MUI (Material Design). No specific colors or logos will be used yet.

## Target Device and Platforms
* **Web Responsive (Desktop-first):** Designed with a primary focus on Desktop Browser usage, but it must also be usable on Tablets and Mobile devices.
