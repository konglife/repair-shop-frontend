# Story 1.4: Implement Login Authentication Logic

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** repair shop owner,
**I want** to authenticate with my login credentials and maintain a secure session,
**so that** I can access the protected areas of the repair shop dashboard application with proper security.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement authentication API call using the existing login form from Story 1.3
2. Handle successful login response by storing JWT token securely
3. Handle login errors with appropriate user feedback on the login form
4. Implement proper loading state management during authentication
5. Store authentication state globally for use across the application
6. Redirect authenticated users to the main dashboard page
7. Implement proper error handling for network failures and invalid credentials
8. Use TypeScript types for all authentication data structures
9. Implement secure token storage following security best practices
10. Add proper form validation before making API calls

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3: The login page UI is fully implemented with MUI components (Card, TextField, Button) and includes comprehensive form validation, loading states, and responsive design. All TypeScript interfaces for form data are already created. The login form is ready for authentication integration at `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`.

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15.4.5 - Use App Router for authentication flow and routing
- **UI Library:** MUI (Material-UI) 7.2.0 - Continue using existing MUI components for consistent design
- **Frontend Language:** TypeScript 5.8 - Use explicit types for all authentication Props, State, and API data
- **State Management:** React 19.1 - Use React Context and Hooks for global authentication state management
- **API Style:** REST - Communication format with the Strapi Backend for authentication
- **Frontend Testing:** Jest & React Testing Library - For unit testing authentication components and services

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Required file locations:
- Authentication service: `src/lib/auth.ts` (utility libraries location)
- Authentication context: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (React contexts location)
- Login page (existing): `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` (already implemented in Story 1.3)
- Test files: Adjacent to components and services following Next.js conventions

### High-Level Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Integration Pattern:** REST API Consumption - Connect to existing Strapi v5 Backend via REST API
- **Frontend Patterns:** Client-Side State Management (React Hooks), Component-Based UI
- **Communication:** HTTPS REST API Request to deployed Strapi Backend service

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **JWT Token Management:** Manage JWT Tokens securely and attach them to every API request that requires authentication
- **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information (like API URLs) in `.env.local`
- **Security Principles:** Implement secure token storage and transmission

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **TypeScript First:** Use explicit types for all Props, State, and API data structures
- **Component Reusability:** Create authentication utilities and context to be reusable across the application
- **Environment Variables:** Configure authentication API endpoints using environment variables

### Authentication Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
No specific authentication models defined in current data models. Authentication will use JWT tokens as mentioned in security principles. Create TypeScript interfaces for:
- Login request data (email/username, password)
- Login response data (JWT token, user info)
- Authentication state (user, token, isAuthenticated status)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **Testing Strategy:** Start by writing Unit Tests for complex logic and components
- **Framework:** Jest & React Testing Library (standard Next.js toolset)
- **Test Location:** Create test files adjacent to components and services following Next.js conventions
- **Authentication Testing:** Test authentication service functions, context state management, and login integration
