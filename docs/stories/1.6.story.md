# Story 1.6: Create Protected Routes

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** repair shop owner,
**I want** proper route protection and navigation structure for authenticated areas of the application,
**so that** I can securely access dashboard features and the application properly manages access to different sections based on authentication status.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create comprehensive route protection system for all main application areas
2. Implement navigation structure for protected routes (products, stock, sales, repairs)
3. Ensure unauthenticated users cannot access protected pages through direct URLs
4. Add proper navigation breadcrumbs and menu structure for main application areas
5. Implement role-based route protection if needed for future expansion
6. Add loading states for route transitions and authentication checks
7. Create consistent layout structure across all protected routes
8. Add proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts
9. Implement proper redirect flow after successful login to intended destination
10. Ensure all protected routes integrate seamlessly with existing authentication context

  - [x] Test unauthorized access scenarios and error handling

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5: **POTENTIAL OVERLAP DETECTED** - Authentication route guards were already implemented:
- withAuth HOC and useAuthGuard hook for automatic redirects already exist
- Route protection was already applied to main application pages
- Authentication context with proper state management is fully operational
- Periodic token validation (every 5 minutes) is already running
**NOTE:** This story may need to focus on expanding the route structure and navigation rather than creating basic protection

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15.4.5 - Use App Router with route groups for protected areas
- **UI Library:** MUI (Material-UI) 7.2.0 - Use MUI components for navigation, breadcrumbs, and layout
- **Frontend Language:** TypeScript 5.8 - Use explicit types for route configuration and navigation props
- **State Management:** React 19.1 - Integrate with existing authentication context for route protection
- **Frontend Testing:** Jest & React Testing Library - For testing route protection and navigation

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Required file locations:
- Protected route pages: `src/app/(main)/products/`, `src/app/(main)/stock/`, `src/app/(main)/sales/`, `src/app/(main)/repairs/`
- Layout components: `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` (already exists - may need enhancement)
- Navigation components: `src/components/common/` - for sidebar navigation and breadcrumbs
- Authentication guards: `src/hooks/` or `src/components/` (already exist - may need extension)
- Route utilities: `src/lib/` - for route configuration and navigation helpers

### High-Level Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Frontend Patterns:** Component-Based UI, Client-Side State Management (React Hooks)
- **Integration Pattern:** REST API Consumption - Protected routes will eventually consume business data APIs
- **Next.js App Router:** Use route groups `(main)` for protected areas and proper layout nesting

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **JWT Token Management:** Integrate with existing secure token validation for route access
- **Route Protection:** Ensure comprehensive protection prevents unauthorized access to business data
- **Authentication State:** Maintain authentication state consistency across route navigation

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **TypeScript First:** Use explicit types for route configuration, navigation state, and protection props
- **Component Reusability:** Create reusable navigation and layout components for protected areas
- **Environment Variables:** Use existing authentication configuration

### Authentication Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
No specific route protection models defined in current data models. Extend existing TypeScript interfaces for:
- Route configuration and navigation state
- Breadcrumb and navigation menu data structures
- Role-based access control for future expansion
- Route loading states and error conditions

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **Testing Strategy:** Unit Tests for route protection and navigation components
- **Framework:** Jest & React Testing Library (standard Next.js toolset)
- **Test Location:** Create test files adjacent to components following Next.js conventions
- **Route Testing:** Test authentication guards, navigation functionality, and unauthorized access scenarios

### Project Structure Notes
Current structure aligns well with authentication infrastructure already in place. Main expansion needed is:
- Creating actual business area page components in `(main)` route group
- Enhancing navigation structure and layout components
- Extending existing authentication guards if needed for comprehensive coverage
