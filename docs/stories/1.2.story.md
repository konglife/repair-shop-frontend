# Story 1.2: Create Basic App Layout

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a main Layout component that provides consistent structure and navigation across all authenticated pages,
**so that** users have a cohesive experience throughout the repair shop dashboard application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create a main layout component that wraps all authenticated pages
2. Include a top navigation bar with the app title and user information area
3. Include a sidebar navigation menu with links to all main sections (Products, Stock, Sales, Repairs, Dashboard)
4. Use MUI components for consistent styling and responsive design
5. Implement proper TypeScript types for all props and components
6. The layout should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices
7. Include placeholder areas for user authentication status and logout functionality

  - [x] Create unit tests for MainLayout component
  - [x] Test navigation functionality and responsive behavior
  - [x] Verify TypeScript compilation with no errors

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: The project structure has been established with (auth) and (main) route groups. The main layout should be integrated with the existing `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` file. MUI 7.2.0 is installed and configured for use.

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15.4.5 - Use Next.js Link components for navigation
- **UI Library:** MUI (Material-UI) 7.2.0 - Use AppBar, Drawer, List, ListItem, and icon components
- **Frontend Language:** TypeScript 5.8 - Use explicit types for all Props, State, and component interfaces
- **State Management:** React 19.1 - Use React Hooks for component state management

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Frontend Patterns:** Component-Based UI, Client-Side State Management (React Hooks)
- Components should be reusable and follow component-based architecture principles

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Required file locations:
- Main layout component: `src/components/common/MainLayout.tsx`
- Integration point: `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx`
- Component directory structure: `/src/components/common/` for shared layout components

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **TypeScript First:** Use explicit types for all Props, State, and API data
- **Component Reusability:** Always create components to be reusable
- Components should be designed for reuse across different contexts

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
No specific data models are required for the basic layout component. Future authentication integration will use JWT tokens as mentioned in security principles.

### Navigation Structure
Based on Epic List, the navigation should include links to:
- Dashboard (main page)
- Products (Epic 2: Product & Stock Management)
- Stock (Epic 2: Product & Stock Management)  
- Sales (Epic 4: Sales & Dashboard Foundation)
- Repairs (Epic 3: Core Operations - Purchases & Repairs)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- Start by writing Unit Tests for complex logic and components
- Use Jest & React Testing Library (standard Next.js toolset)
- Test file location: Follow Next.js conventions (create `MainLayout.test.tsx` adjacent to component)

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- Prepare structure for JWT Token management in future authentication features
- Authentication placeholders should be ready for secure token handling
