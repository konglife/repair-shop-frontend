# Story 1.5: Implement Logout and Global Auth State

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** logged-in repair shop owner,
**I want** to log out of the application securely and have proper global authentication state management,
**so that** I can end my session safely and the application can properly track my authentication status across all pages and components.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement logout functionality that clears authentication tokens and session data
2. Add logout button or menu item to the main application layout
3. Ensure logout redirects user to login page after clearing session
4. Implement proper token expiration handling and automatic logout
5. Extend global authentication context to manage authentication state across the entire application
6. Implement authentication guards for protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users
7. Add proper loading states during authentication status checks
8. Implement token refresh mechanism if needed for session persistence
9. Add proper error handling for authentication state management
10. Ensure all authentication state changes are properly reflected in the UI

  - [x] Test error handling and edge cases

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4: Authentication infrastructure is fully implemented with:
- Complete authentication API service at `src/lib/auth.ts` with secure token storage
- Robust global authentication context at `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` using React Context API with useReducer
- Authentication state management (login, logout, token validation) already partially implemented
- Custom hook for accessing auth context already available
- Integration with login page completed with proper error handling and redirects

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15.4.5 - Use App Router for route protection and navigation
- **UI Library:** MUI (Material-UI) 7.2.0 - Use MUI components for logout UI elements (Button, Menu, Dialog)
- **Frontend Language:** TypeScript 5.8 - Use explicit types for all authentication Props, State, and logout functions
- **State Management:** React 19.1 - Extend existing React Context and Hooks for comprehensive auth state management
- **Frontend Testing:** Jest & React Testing Library - For unit testing logout functionality and route guards

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Required file locations:
- Authentication service (existing): `src/lib/auth.ts` - extend with logout functions
- Authentication context (existing): `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - enhance with logout and route guard logic
- Main layout: `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` - add logout UI components
- Protected route utilities: `src/hooks/` or `src/components/` - for authentication guards
- Test files: Adjacent to components and services following Next.js conventions

### High-Level Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Integration Pattern:** REST API Consumption - Logout may require API call to invalidate server-side sessions if implemented
- **Frontend Patterns:** Client-Side State Management (React Hooks), Component-Based UI
- **Communication:** Coordinate with existing Strapi Backend service for session management

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **JWT Token Management:** Securely clear JWT tokens on logout and implement proper token expiration handling
- **Session Security:** Ensure complete session cleanup prevents unauthorized access after logout
- **Route Protection:** Implement proper authentication guards to protect sensitive application areas

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **TypeScript First:** Use explicit types for all logout Props, State, and authentication guard functions
- **Component Reusability:** Create reusable authentication utilities and route protection components
- **Environment Variables:** Use existing authentication configuration from environment variables

### Authentication Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
No specific authentication models defined in current data models. Extend existing TypeScript interfaces for:
- Authentication state with logout status tracking
- Route protection state and loading indicators
- Token expiration and refresh data structures
- Logout confirmation and error states

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **Testing Strategy:** Start by writing Unit Tests for logout functionality and authentication guards
- **Framework:** Jest & React Testing Library (standard Next.js toolset)
- **Test Location:** Create test files adjacent to components and services following Next.js conventions
- **Logout Testing:** Test logout functionality, route guards, state management, and error scenarios
