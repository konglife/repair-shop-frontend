# Story 1.3: Develop Login Page UI

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** repair shop owner,
**I want** to have a professional and user-friendly login page interface,
**so that** I can securely access the repair shop dashboard application with a clean and intuitive experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create a dedicated login page accessible at /login route (inside the (auth) route group)
2. Design a clean, centered login form using MUI components
3. Include email/username input field with appropriate validation styling
4. Include password input field with show/hide password toggle functionality
5. Include a login button that follows MUI design standards
6. Implement responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
7. Use proper TypeScript types for all form components and state
8. Include basic form validation UI feedback (required fields, error states)
9. Add loading state UI for when authentication is in progress
10. Include "Repair Shop Dashboard" branding/title on the login page

  - [x] Test form rendering and basic interactions
  - [x] Test responsive behavior across breakpoints
  - [x] Test validation UI feedback functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: The project structure uses (auth) and (main) route groups. MUI 7.2.0 is fully configured and available. The MainLayout component has been created for authenticated pages, but login page should be separate from this layout.

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15.4.5 - Use Next.js App Router for /login route inside (auth) group
- **UI Library:** MUI (Material-UI) 7.2.0 - Use TextField, Button, Paper/Card, Typography components
- **Frontend Language:** TypeScript 5.8 - Use explicit types for all form Props, State, and validation
- **State Management:** React 19.1 - Use React Hooks (useState) for form state management
- **Frontend Testing:** Jest & React Testing Library - For unit testing form components

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Required file locations:
- Login page: `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` (already structured in project)
- Test file: `src/app/(auth)/login/page.test.tsx` (adjacent to component)
- Authentication route group: Uses `(auth)` directory structure separate from `(main)`

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Frontend Patterns:** Component-Based UI, Client-Side State Management (React Hooks)
- **Integration Pattern:** Prepared for REST API consumption (authentication will be implemented in next story)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **TypeScript First:** Use explicit types for all Props, State, and form data structures
- **Component Reusability:** Create form components that could be reusable
- **Environment Variables:** Prepare for API endpoint configuration in future stories

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
No specific data models required for UI-only story. Future authentication will use JWT tokens as mentioned in security principles.

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- Prepare form structure for secure JWT Token handling in next story (1.4)
- Do not implement actual authentication logic in this UI-only story

### UI Design Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md]
- **Design Style:** Minimalist, Efficient, and User-friendly using MUI (Material Design)
- **Target Devices:** Desktop-first but responsive for Tablets and Mobile
- **Forms:** Use Forms pattern for authentication input
- **Branding:** Use basic MUI design with "Repair Shop Dashboard" title

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-and-operational-standards.md]
- **Testing Strategy:** Start by writing Unit Tests for complex logic and components
- **Framework:** Jest & React Testing Library (standard Next.js toolset)
- **Test Location:** Create test files adjacent to components following Next.js conventions
